Рецензия:
soooo i've finished TGTBU in two days, and let me tell you that it was as good as the first one! i love those characters, i love the vibe, and yeah, the plot is predictable sometimes (like i guessed two villains instantly because obviously they were suspicious af), BUT this book slightly changed my attitude towards Aaron? like how unexpected was THAT?????overall, great sequel, i can't wait to read the third book in the series, and by the way thank you, Caroline, for some OCD and self-harm representation, that's really important to me <3
