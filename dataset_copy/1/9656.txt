Рецензия:
(this is literally an essay I wrote for my Uni English class two years ago - it's technically not a proper review but a comparison of two other reviews, but my opinion on the book is there, so whatever)
“Normal People” by Sally Rooney sucks. Okay, how’s that for a catcher? Alright, maybe it doesn’t, who knows, nobody can give you an objective opinion about a book but at least I don’t pretend that I see some deeper meaning where I don’t. Neither do both reviewers from “Guardian” and “The Sydney Morning Herald”, even though they have different opinions.
Jessa Crispin from “Guardian” literally takes words from my mouth. This book contains the most generic love story which pretends to be “the great Millennial novel”. The author tries to throw anything she can into the mix from her conception…
